# Simple Shell - Simple shell team project

This is the solution for the STACKS, QUEUES - LIFO, FIFO  project for ALX low level programming language [ALX SWE](https://alxafrica.com). A team project to improve collaborations and problem solving skills amongst ALX students.

## Overview

### The requirements

The general requirements for the project tasks were:

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty`
- Outputs were printed on stdout
- Error messages were printed on stderr
- All files ended with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project was created
- Code used the Betty style
- A maximum of one global variable was used
- No more than 5 functions per file
- C standard libraries were used
- The prototypes of all functions were included in the header file called `monty.h`
- All header files were 'include guarded'
- A README with the description of the project was written

### The challenge

The project was to achieve the following:

- Implement the push and pall opcodes.
  - The opcode `pall` is expected to prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
  - Usage `pall`
  - Nothing is printed, if the stack is empty
- Implement the pint opcode
  - The opcode `pint` prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
  - Usage: `pint`
  - The error message `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty` is printed if the stack is empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
- Implement the pop opcode
  - The opcode `pop` removes the top element of the stack.
  - Usage: `pop`
  - The error message `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty` is printed if the stack is e\mpty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
- Implement the swap opcode
  - The opcode `swap` swaps the top two elements of the stack.
  - Usage: `swap`
  - The error message `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty` is printed if the stack is e\mpty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`- Handle errors
- Implement the add opcode
  - The opcode `add` adds the top two elements of the stack.
  - Usage: `add`
  - The error message `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty` is printed if the stack is e\mpty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`- Handle errors.
  - The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
    - The top element of the stack contains the result
    - The stack is one element shorter
- Implement the nop opcode
  - The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything.
  - Usage: `nop`

### Functions and descriptions

The several functions used to making the simple shell project in its entirety and their descriptions are thus:

| Function          | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| main              | The entry point of the main program                                 |
| __push       | Pushes an element to the stack |
| __pall | Prints all the values on the stack starting from top of the stack      |
| \_\_find_commands | This finds the mocked commands and run them appropraitely           |
| \_\_fork_command  | This creates a child process and forks an execution thread          |
| \_\_error_puts    | This writes an error message to the STDERR                          |
| \_realloc         | This reallocate a block of memory                                   |

Quite a number of functions were used to get the program to work appropraitely

### Compilation

The code(s) was compiled this way:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```

### Testing

```
odopeter@root:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                     pall    $
push 4$
      push 5    $
	push    6        $
pall$
```

## My process

### Built with

The project, was built with C language.

### What we learned

**\*\***....... What we both learned in the course of the tasks goes here, we will keep updating (this part individually, probably after each task) as time goes by .......**\*\*\*\***

### Continued development

What we hope to do after completing this tasks, eg, implementing more of the functionalities of a regular UNIX shell, etc...
**\*\***....... (We will also update this with suitable ideas in due time) .......**\*\*\*\***

### Useful resources

[Code Blocks](https://docs.readme.com/rdmd) - The rdmd docs from this site helped us to write a well structured readme for this project, alongside proper formatting of inline codes and code blocks

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This aided us to help find questions and appropraite answers to bugs we faced while doing the project. (we can come add more to this later)

[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/) - GitHub Docs was used to create nicely formatted tables for writing functions and their descriptions.

[Geeks For Geeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org) - Geeks for geeks, a great place for well detailed technical articles encompassing several programming languages, this helped in getting several informations on how some of the functions works.

[Youtube Channels](https://youtube.com) - Combinations of several channels and videos was used to aid the completion of this project, I will suggest that anyone wanting to top their developing game, should use Youtube more often.

[Google](https://google.com) - Google was the icing on the cake, as almost everything, started and ended with Google, a timely and accurate search can salvage one hours of debugging problems.
